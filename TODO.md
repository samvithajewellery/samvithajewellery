# Cart Functionality Update TODO

## Tasks Completed
- [x] Remove cart modal from all HTML files (cart.html, bangles.html, etc.)
- [x] Update cart nav links to href="cart.html" across all pages
- [x] Update add-to-cart buttons to redirect to cart.html after adding item
- [x] Ensure cart.html displays cart items using cart.js
- [x] Remove modal-related functions from script.js (kept for potential future use)

## Notes
- Cart functionality now uses dedicated cart.html page instead of modal popup.
- Add to cart redirects to cart.html for immediate cart view.
- Cart items are stored in localStorage and displayed on cart.html.
